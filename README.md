# Anki Add-on Build Script

A build script for Anki add-ons intended for my own use. Inspired by [ankitects/anki-addons](https://github.com/ankitects/anki-addons) and [glutanimate/anki-addon-builder](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addon-builder). Take a look at Glutanimate's add-on builder if you want something more mature and tested.

## Structure

See my [Anki add-on template](https://github.com/abdnh/anki-addon-template) for some description of the file structure expected by the script.

## TODO

-   [ ] tests
-   [ ] docs
